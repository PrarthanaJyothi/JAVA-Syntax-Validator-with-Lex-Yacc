# JAVA-syntax-Validator-with-Lex-Yacc

This program has two parts. (JAVA declaration syntax validation)

The first part validates whether a given function declaration is a valid function declaration or not.

The second part validates whether a given variable declaration is a valid variable declaration or not.

We use Lex-Yacc here. 

Since the program doesn't take user inputs, to use your own test cases, change the test cases in the program.


To install needed modules:

pip install ply
